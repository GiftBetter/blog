            <p>
Gift Better is building its platform using one source
of truth on a large mono-repo.  </p>
<p>
Here’s our approach.</p>
<p>
The code is organized in a boring manner</p>
<pre><code>/ docs
/ libs
/ tools
/ [app]*</code></pre>
<h3>
Docs</h3>
<p>
We keep all technical documentation directly within
the code, so that when the code changes we can 
keep the documentation up-to-date.</p>
<h3>
Libs</h3>
<p>
Our code base is <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">elixir</a>
but our various <code class="inline">[app]*</code> will rely on common code
that we manage in separate libraries.</p>
<pre><code>{:kore, path: &quot;../libs/kore&quot;},
{:salesforce, path: &quot;../libs/salesforce&quot;},</code></pre>
<p>
All catchall re-usable code goes into <code class="inline">kore</code>.</p>
<h3>
Tools</h3>
<p>
Most scripts are managed in our <code class="inline">tools</code> directory.
The primary scripts include</p>
<pre><code>- gencode # builds out certain parts of the system
- gendata # (re)generates core gifting data
- gendocs # (re)generates our documentation
- deploy  # deploys an [app] to production
- setup   # help setup developer environment </code></pre>
<p>
There nice cohesion to keep these scripts together
with a, for example, consistent way to deploy our
apps with</p>
<pre><code>./tools/deploy giftdb
./tools/deploy gbideas
#./tools/deploy blog</code></pre>
<p>
We also want to de-couple from specific CI/CD
vendor lock in. For example, our GitHub Actions 
build script can be run (and more importantly tested/debugged)
outside of GitHub; by delegating to our pipeline scripts.</p>
<pre><code>- name: Setup Projects
  run: ./tools/pipeline/setup

- name: Run tests
  run: ./tools/pipeline/tests</code></pre>
<h3>
One directory per [app]</h3>
<p>
Each <em>deployable</em> application is (currently) at the root 
of the project. Presently, we have three applications</p>
<ul>
  <li>
giftdb (our main gifting platform)  </li>
  <li>
gbideas (our AI/ML corporategiftbot.com service)  </li>
  <li>
blog (this blog, a simple static site published to GitHub Pages)  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
Why, Why, Why?</h2>
<p>
A little bit of thinking behind our <code class="inline">monorepo</code> architecture.</p>
<h3>
Monorepo isn’t that uncommon</h3>
<p>
There is a separation between the organization of your code
and its deployment.  This can be split along both axes.</p>
<div class="mx-auto max-w-3xl">
    <table class="mx-auto divide-y divide-gray-300 text-center">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="py-3.5 pl-4 pr-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 sm:pl-0"></th>
        <td class="px-3 py-3.5 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">1 deploy</td>
        <td class="px-3 py-3.5 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">N deploys</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
      <tr>
        <th class="whitespace-nowrap py-4 pl-4 pr-3 text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 sm:pl-0">1 repo</th>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-3 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Monolith</td>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-3 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Monorepo</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th class="whitespace-nowrap py-4 pl-4 pr-3 text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 sm:pl-0">N repos</th>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-3 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Microlith
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap px-3 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500">SOA (Service Oriented)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table></div>
<p>
Many conflate <code class="inline">1 repo</code> and the <code class="inline">Monolith</code>, as you can (and we do)
serve up many applications (aka N deploys) from the one repository.
And, the ability to keep code decoupled might <em>seem</em> easier within
N repos, it is more about having a <em>good design</em> that clearly
demarks responbility between entities.</p>
<p>
I have also seen many projects that think they are <code class="inline">service oriented</code>,
in that they have N repos (one per service).  In reality though,
those services are tightly coupled and typically <strong>must</strong> be
deployed <em>together</em> resulting in what I am calling a <code class="inline">Microlith</code>.</p>
<p>
In 2016, Google (Rachel Potvin and Josh Levenberg) publisehd <a href="https://research.google/pubs/why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/">“Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository”</a>
in the ACM giving a good overview of their code structure.</p>
<p>
Our team has decided on the <code class="inline">Monorepo</code> (1 repo N deploys) for a two key reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Simpler  </li>
  <li>
More malleable  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Having one repository is far simpler than tracking multiple
repos including </p>
<p>
a. Simpler access for development (aka clone one repo
not several)
b. Simpler access to re-usable code (aka no need for git submodules,
a package deployments)
c. Consistency between development environments (aka scripts can 
know exactly where all the code resides)</p>
<p>
But, our code base is also more malleable</p>
<p>
a. We can extract common code into libraries <em>at any time</em> and apply
the changes within one pull-request
b. We can easily <strong>refactor</strong> code with <em>copy and replace</em> (again
applying all changes within one pull-request)
c. We can easily <em>restructure</em> the code should a <strong>better</strong> directory
structure <em>emerge</em> as the code evolves.</p>
<p>
As the project evolves, so too can our code structure.</p>
<h3>
Keeping it simple with a monorepo</h3>
<p>
(John) <a href="http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law">Gall’s Law</a> posits</p>
<blockquote>
  A complex system that works is invariably found to have 
evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse 
proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed 
from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. 
You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.</blockquote>
<p>
As such, we wanted to start simple and then evolve it based on
actual needs, not assumed one.</p>
