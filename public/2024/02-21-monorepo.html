            <p>
Gift Better is building its platform using one source
of truth on a large mono-repo.  </p>
<p>
Here’s our approach.</p>
<p>
The code is organized in a boring manner</p>
<pre><code>/ docs
/ libs
/ tools
/ [app]*
/ README.md</code></pre>
<h3>
Docs</h3>
<p>
We keep all technical documentation directly within
the code, so that when the code changes we can 
keep the documentation up-to-date.</p>
<h3>
Libs</h3>
<p>
Our code base is <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">elixir</a>
but our various <code class="inline">[app]*</code> will rely on common code
that we manage in separate libraries.</p>
<pre><code>{:kore, path: &quot;../libs/kore&quot;},
{:salesforce, path: &quot;../libs/salesforce&quot;},</code></pre>
<p>
All catchall re-usable code goes into <code class="inline">kore</code>.</p>
<p>
We also, as much as possible, generate documentation
from raw sources</p>
<pre><code>- gencode # builds out certain parts of the system
- gendata # (re)generates core gifting data
- gendocs # (re)generates our documentation
- deploy  # deploys an [app] to production
- setup   # help setup developer environment </code></pre>
<p>
Our tools focus on global scripts to generate things
(code, data, docs), deploy applications and help setup
developerment environments.</p>
<h2>
Some justifications</h2>
<p>
There is a separation between the organization of your code
and its deployment.  This can be split along both axes.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">
      </th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">
1 deploy      </th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">
N deploys      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
1 repo      </td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
Monolith      </td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
Monorepo      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
N repos      </td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
Microlith      </td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">
SOA (Service Oriented)      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
Many conflate <code class="inline">1 repo</code> and the <code class="inline">Monolith</code>, as you can (and we do)
serve up many applications (aka N deploys) from the one repository.
And, the ability to keep code decoupled might <em>seem</em> easier within
N repos, it is more about having a <em>good design</em> that clearly
demarks responbility between entities.</p>
<p>
I have also seen many projects that think they are <code class="inline">service oriented</code>,
in that they have N repos (one per service).  In reality though,
those services are tightly coupled and typically <strong>must</strong> be
deployed <em>together</em> resulting in what I am calling a <code class="inline">Microlith</code>.</p>
<p>
In 2016, Google (Rachel Potvin and Josh Levenberg) publisehd <a href="https://research.google/pubs/why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/">“Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository”</a>
in the ACM giving a good overview of their code structure.</p>
<p>
Our team has decided on the <code class="inline">Monorepo</code> (1 repo N deploys) for a two key reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Simpler  </li>
  <li>
More malleable  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Having one repository is far simpler than tracking multiple
repos including </p>
<p>
a. Simpler access for development (aka clone one repo
not several)
b. Simpler access to re-usable code (aka no need for git submodules,
a package deployments)
c. Consistency between development environments (aka scripts can 
know exactly where all the code resides)</p>
<p>
But, our code base is also more malleable</p>
<p>
a. We can extract common code into libraries <em>at any time</em> and apply
the changes within one pull-request
b. We can easily <strong>refactor</strong> code with <em>copy and replace</em> (again
applying all changes within one pull-request)
c. We can easily <em>restructure</em> the code should a <strong>better</strong> directory
structure <em>emerge</em> as the code evolves.</p>
<p>
As the project evolves, so too can our code structure.</p>
